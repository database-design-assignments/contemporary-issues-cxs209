NOTE: I've just joined class yesterday (2/3), so I've made every effort to catch up. Hopefully this does not count as late.


# Modern day data security in businesses
In this document, I discuss two articles about modern day data security in businesses. I present and discuss two views on this important matter tackling from different angles.

## Article 1
In Rudina Seseri's [Establishing Trust in 2021: Innovation and an Imperative for Embracing Data Privacy, Transparency and Security](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/363944), she discusses modern day data privacy and security among businesses: the importance and threats.

Seseri argued that most companies do not have sufficient data protection policies implemented, especially small startups as they do not meet the minimum criteria necessary to be compliant with data privacy regulations. This would be a problem not only because their data would be easily penetrable, but also because it prevents them from scaling, yet many people lack the money, awareness, or technological knowledge to implement these security methods as the business just starts.

I agree with Seseri in that if the data is not disposable, then it should be protected from the start, that is either implementing the technology themselve or enlisting a third-party firm. It's like wearing seatbelts during driver, you don't notice the consequences of not doing so until an accidental actually happens, and only then you regret your decision of not implementing data protection policies.

## Article 2
Simon Moser's article [Why IT Security Will be a Prime Concern for Businesses in the Next Decade](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/355950) discusses the rise in cybersecurity attacks this year.

Moser starts out the gate by listing the numbers of cybersecurity attacks this year. He states that how coronavirus and rapid expansion of digitalization has increased the vulnerability of virtual threats, leading to more security attacks -- from phishing attempts to massive data breaches such as the Twitter breach and the Zoom breaches. As a result, Moser argues that data security will become a growing concern for businesses in the coming decade, as the title suggests.

As opposed to Seseri's article where a lot of the concerns is for startups, Moser highlights that data protection is still a massive issue for even big businesses that already have some data security policies implemented. I believe this is totally true as the data security issue in my opinion is a never ending issue. There would always be a period when security technology advances, then data is safe for a while, then hackers would improve their technology to counteract that, then new security technologies are developed. This struggle would always exist, we just hope to contain it as much as possible.
